# OregonLampreyDistributionModel
### Species Distribution Models for Pacific Lamprey and Western Brook Lamprey
#### Parker Jung
I will be making models to predict the presence of pacific lamprey and western brook lamprey in the southern Oregon coastal watershed based on detected presence at sample sites. The objective of this project is to use species presence at points to visualize the distributions on a watershed scale.
